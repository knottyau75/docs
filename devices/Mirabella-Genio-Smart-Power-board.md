#Mirabella Genio Smart Powerboard

This is a 4-way powerboard with the addition of a 2 USB ports.

Opening up the device was easy, but requires the use of a Tri-Wing Screwdriver ( like a phillips, but with 3 slots)

![ESP8266 PINOUT](https://i.ibb.co/YRQstXr/ESP-PIN-OUT.png)

The ESP module is mounted on a pcb with all of the required pins exposed.

I was able to flash by using Tuyaconvert and by connecting GPIO0 to GND while connecting my Serial Adaptor and flashing as per any other ESP device.
